A big welcome and thank you for considering contributing to open source projects! Itâ€™s people like you that make it a reality for users in our community.We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

## Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover both:

- Search for [existing Issues](https://github.com/robotics-club-sist/robotics-club-sist.github.io/issues) and PRs before creating your own.
- We work hard to makes sure issues are handled in a timely manner but, depending on the impact, it could take a while to investigate the root cause. A friendly ping in the comment thread to the submitter or a contributor can help draw attention if your issue is blocking.

## Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with the code, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created.

### Create a new issue

When you create a [new Issue](https://github.com/robotics-club-sist/robotics-club-sist.github.io/issues/new/choose), a template will be loaded that will guide you through collecting and providing the information we need to investigate.

If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one. Adding a reaction can also help be indicating to our maintainers that a particular problem is affecting more than just the reporter.

### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/robotics-club-sist/robotics-club-sist.github.io/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using labels as filters. See Labels for more information. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

## Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

- Fill the [Pull Request](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Once you submit your PR, team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request for additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can make changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

## Contributing

In general, we follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

 1. **Fork** the repository to your own Github account<br\>
    [NOTE: keep a reference to the original project in "upstream remote".]
 2. **Clone** the project to your own machine
 3. Create a **branch** locally with a succinct but descriptive name
 4. **Commit** changes to your own branch<br\>
    [NOTE: A PR should have only one commit. Multiple commits should be "squashed".]
 5. **Push** your work back up to your fork
 6. Open a **PR** in our repository and follow the **PR template** so that we can efficiently review the changes.<br\>
    [NOTE: Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request!]

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
