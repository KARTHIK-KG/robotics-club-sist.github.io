# Robotics Club - SIST Community Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, colour, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for
all.

Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

- Be kind and courteous to others
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Respecting the identity of every community member, including asking for their
    pronouns if uncertain
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Collaborating with other community members
- Providing desired assistance and knowledge to other community members
- Being open to new information and ideas
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and sexual attention or advances
- The use of inappropriate images, including in a community member's avatar
- The use of inappropriate language or profanity, including in a community member's nickname
- Any spamming, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behaviour
- Excessive or unwelcome helping; answering outside the scope of the question
    asked
- Discussion or promotion of activities or projects that intend or pose a risk of
    significant harm
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and attacks of any nature (including,
    but not limited to, personal or political attacks)
- Promoting or spreading disinformation, lies, or conspiracy theories against
    a person, group, organisation, project, or community
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing other's private information, such as a physical or electronic
    address, without explicit permission
- Engaging in behaviour that creates an unwelcoming or uninclusive environment
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

The Robotics Club - SIST Community welcomes everyone and strives to create a safe space for all. It is built around sharing and contributing to technology. We encourage discussing your thoughts, experiences, and feelings within the scope of the community. However, there are topics that can sometimes stray from that scope and can lead to hurting others and creating an unwelcoming, uninclusive environment.

Examples of discussion topics that have been known to stray outside the scope of the Robotics Club - SIST Community include, but are not limited to:

- Discussions regarding religion and related topics
- Discussions regarding politics and related topics

The goal of the standards and moderation guidelines outlined here is to build
and maintain a respectful community. We ask that you don’t just aim to be
"technically unimpeachable", but rather try to be your best self.

We value many things beyond technical expertise, including collaboration and
supporting others within our community. Providing a positive experience for
other community members can have a much more significant impact than simply
providing the correct answer.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behaviour and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behaviour that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Moderation

Instances of behaviours that violate the Robotics Club - SIST Community Code of Conduct
may be reported by any member of the community. Community members are
encouraged to report these situations, including situations they witness
involving other community members.

You may report in the following ways:

In any situation, you may email roboticsclubsist@gmail.com

On the Robotics Club - SIST Discord, you may send an open message from any channel
to all Community Moderators by tagging @moderators. You may
also send an open message from the #support channel, or a
direct message to any Community Moderator.

The source of the email and direct message reports will be kept confidential.

In situations on Discord where the issue is particularly offensive, possibly
illegal requires immediate action, or violates the Discord terms of service,
you should also report the message directly to [Discord](https://discord.com/safety).

These are the steps for upholding our community’s standards of conduct.

1. Any member of the community may report any situation that violates the
   Robotics Club - SIST Community Code of Conduct. All reports will be reviewed and
   investigated.
2. If the behaviour is a severe violation, the community member who
   committed the violation may be banned immediately, without warning.
3. Otherwise, moderators will first respond to such behaviour with a warning.
4. Moderators follow a soft "three strikes" policy - the community member may
   be given another chance if they are receptive to the warning and change their
   behaviour.
5. If the community member is unreceptive or unreasonable when warned by a
   moderator, or the warning goes unheeded, they may be banned for a first or
   second offence. Repeated offences will result in the community member being
   banned.
6. Disciplinary actions (warnings, bans, etc) for Code of Conduct violations apply
   to the platform where the violation occurred. However, depending on the severity
   of the violation, the disciplinary action may be applied across Robotics Club - SIST's other
   community platforms. For example, a severe violation on the Robotics Club - SIST Discord
   server may result in a ban on not only the Robotics Club - SIST Discord server, but also on
   the Robotics Club - SIST GitHub organisation, Robotics Club - SIST Instagram, Robotics Club - SIST LinkedIn, etc.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct and the enforcement policies listed above apply to all
Robotics Club - SIST Community venues. This includes but is not limited to any community
spaces (both public and private), the entire Robotics Club - SIST Discord server, and
Robotics Club - SIST GitHub repositories.

Examples of Robotics Club - SIST Community spaces include but are not limited to using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, meet-ups, audio chats on the Robotics Club - SIST Discord, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

As a community member, you are representing our community, and are expected to behave
accordingly.
